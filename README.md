Freelance Hub (FL Hub) is a project intended to simplify freelancer's work. A pro-active freelancer is always seeking for new job opportunities because he is trying to find more interesting projects, trying to increase income from day to day. Job search can take up to an hour per day and even more if the freelancer is going to be among the first bidders to increase his chances to get awarded. Here is when FL Hub comes to optimize time expense and notify about the latest and the hottest jobs.

### Technical stuff ###

This project was started as a MEAN stack project intended to work on web. But it became obvious that there is much more sense to make a mobile app. Xamarin was selected to be the base technology.

### Integrations ###

UpWork - here is their docs on API: [https://developers.upwork.com/](https://developers.upwork.com/)

Invoice generator by Invoiced - [https://github.com/Invoiced/invoice-generator-api](https://github.com/Invoiced/invoice-generator-api)

### Ideas for the future ###

This project might be transformed to be a tiny mobile CRM software for freelancers. Some features:

* Job search (already being implemented)
* Customers database (integration with freelance boards like UpWork to fetch past and current clients)
* Messaging (integration with freelance boards messaging)
* Invoice generation (direct invoices to clients as well as to freelance boards)
* Reporting
